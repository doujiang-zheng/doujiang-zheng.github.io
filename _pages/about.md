Ph.D. Student \| Visual Intelligence and Pattern Analysis Lab \| Zhejiang University

Biography
======
I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in the [Visual Intelligence and Pattern Analysis (VIPA)](https://www.vipazoo.cn/) Lab @ [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Mingli Song](https://person.zju.edu.cn/msong) and Prof. [Chun Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/chenc). I received the B.Eng. degree from the School of Data and Computer Science, [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/), in 2019. My current research interests include reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, and power systems. I serve as a reviewer for IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering and Information Sciences.
