**Ph.D. Student** \| **Visual Intelligence and Pattern Analysis Lab** \| **Zhejiang University**

Biography
======

I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in the [Visual Intelligence and Pattern Analysis (VIPA) Lab](https://www.vipazoo.cn/) @ [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), advised by Prof. [Mingli Song](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/msong) and Prof. [Chun Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/chenc). I received the B.Eng. degree from the School of Data and Computer Science, [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/), in 2019. My current research interests include **reinforcement learning**, **multi-agent systems**, and **power systems**. **Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research :)**
